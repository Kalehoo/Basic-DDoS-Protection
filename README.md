Basic solution where HTTP-server takes raw body requests, and reacts in given config banning IP exceeding the request per second limit.

NOTE: Code is just a demonstration, whole code is not suggestable to use as it is as a base of server infrastructure. Otherwise free to use.
Getting mentioned in such a case is welcome, not mandatory.
